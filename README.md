# MI Algorithm Collection

Welcome to the MI Algorithm Collection repository! Here, you'll find a curated assortment of machine intelligence algorithms I've learned.

## Overview

This repository serves as a curated collection of various machine intelligence algorithms explored during my learning journey. Each folder houses a distinct algorithm along with relevant code, notebooks, and data used for experimentation. Some algorithms may contain hard-coded datasets within the script files for experimentation purposes.

### Repository Structure

- **Algorithm Scripts:** Each algorithm resides in its own script file showcasing the implementation.
- **Test Scripts:** Associated test scripts for validating and experimenting with the algorithms.
- **Datasets:** Some algorithms may have hard-coded datasets embedded within the script files.
